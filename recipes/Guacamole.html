    <h1>How To Make Guacamole</h1>
    <img src="../images/guacamele.png"
    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            It's a tortilla chip's BFF, but guacamole was originally created in the 16th century as a sauce rather than a dip. Let's raise a toast to the Aztecs for coming up with this simple dish that has become a party essential.

The best thing about this red hot green stuff? It's so versatile. It can be a munch-able masterpiece whether it's a simple, super easy recipe or something fancy with a long list of ingredients. It can be mild or fiery hot.
        </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced fresh serrano chili</li>
        <li>Â½ cup chopped fresh cilantro, divided</li>
        <li> teaspoon kosher salt for grinding vegetables, plus more to taste</li>
        <li>4 large Hass avocados</li>
        <li>1 cup diced ripe tomatoes, drained (Optional)</li>
        <li>1 lime, juiced, or more to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place minced peppers, 1/4 cup of the chopped cilantro, and the diced onions on a cutting board. Chop them together into very small pieces. Sprinkle with kosher salt. Using the flat side of the knife blade, smear the mixture to work it into a paste, and chop again to achieve as fine a texture as possible.</li>
        <li>Stem, halve, and pit the avocados. Scoop out flesh and place in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Add 1/4 cup chopped cilantro, onion and serrano mixture, salt, and fresh lime juice. Mash with a potato masher to desired texture (smooth or chunky), five or six minutes.</li>
        <li>Taste and adjust seasonings. If not serving immediately, cover and refrigerate.</li>
    </ol>
